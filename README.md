This is a program I have created start to finish to easily transfer data between two Excel sheets.

You start by selecting your source file, your template file, and where you want the new file to be created. 
Then you map the source columns to the template columns and create the new excel file.

Settings can also be saved/loaded to save time on creating mappings.
